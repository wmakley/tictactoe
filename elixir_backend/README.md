# Elixir Backend

The Elixir backend simply uses Phoenix, as I don't have enough experience to
wire together the lower level libraries myself for all the web stuff in Elixir
(although I would absolutely love to, and that might be a project for another
day).

This backend is unfinished.

## Phoenix Boilerplate

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
